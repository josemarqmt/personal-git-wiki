## Git Fundamentals

### Main or Master
When you create a git repository, the default brands are Main or Master, often the main ones.

### Git states
  - Modified: 
    The file has changed but there is no confirmation to send.
  - Staged:
    The file is modified and marked as ready.
  - Committed:
    The file is saved in the repository.

### Head
The pointer that references the current point in the commit history

### .gitignore
The file indicates that Git should ignore certain file names from being tracked in the repository. <br> 
Also is possible to create a .gitignore global file in the home user directory  -> "~/.gitignore_global and write" -> "git config --global core.excludesfile" ~/.gitignore_global in the terminal
> Files that should be ignored
>
> Credentials or .env files
>
> ide configuration files
>
> systems files like .DS_Store
>
> log files
>
> Static or build files like /dist or /build directory

## Git Commands

<a name="id2.1"> </a>
### Git Config - Get and set repository or global options
> add --system, --global or local to a git config command to specify where the configuration will be established
> 
> --system -> The configuration will be applied for the entire systems and repository including all the users
> 
> --global -> The configuration will be applied for the current user"
> 
> --local -> The configuration will be applied for the current repository"
- Show current git configuration, add --system, --global or --local to filter the configuration you want to see
```
git config --list
```
- Associate username and email to commits in your device
```
git config  user.name "<your name>"
git config  user.email "<your email>"
```
- Set git default editor
```
git config --global core.editor "editor name"
```
- Use fast forward merge whenever possible
```
git config --global merge.ff only
```

<a name="id2.2"> </a>
### Git Essential Commands
- Show installed git version
```
git version
```
- Show a command description
```
git <verb> --help
```

<a name="id2.3"> </a>
### Git Repository Management
- Initialize a new repository in the folder located
```
git init
```
- Show repository status
```
git status
git status -s # Shows the output of the command in a simplified form.
```

<a name="id2.4"> </a>
### Git File Management
- Track a file and add it to the staging area
```
git add <file>
git add -A #add all the files that have been modified in the repository to the staging area
```
- Stop file tracking and remove it from the staging area
```
git reset <file>
```
- Undo a modified file
```
git restore <file>
git checkout -- <file>
```
- Delete all new untracked files (not added to the staging area)
```
git clean -n # shows which files will be deleted
git clean -f # delete the files
```
- Delete a file from the repository but keep it in your file directory
```
git rm --cached <file>
```

<a name="id2.5"> </a>
### Git Commit Management
- Create commits in the repository history with the current state of the files added to the staging area
```
git commit # This will open the previously configured editor to add the message
git commit -m "title" -m "description" # Write the commit title and description directly using the terminal
```

- Add the files to the staging area and commit simultaneously
```
git commit -a -m 'message'
```

- Move HEAD to a previous commit
```
git reset --soft HEAD~1 # The files committed in the last commit will be moved to the staging area
git reset HEAD~1 # The files committed will remain but as unstaged
git reset --hard HEAD~1 # The files committed will lose any changes made and new files will be removed
```

- Add new changes and/or change the message of the last commit
```
git commit --amend -m "message"
```

<a name="id2.6"> </a>
### Git Branch Management
- Create a new branch in the repository based on the current commit of the branch you're on
```
git branch <branch>
```
- Switch to an existing branch
```
git switch <branch>
```
- Create a new branch and switch to it directly
```
git switch -c <branch>
```
- Show a list of available branches locally
```
git branch

# Return the list sorted by creation date
git branch --sort=-committerdate #DESC
git branch --sort=committerdate  #ASC
```

- Merges changes made in another branch into the current branch
> git merge uses fast-forward or no fast-forward depending on the state of the branches being merged, but you can choose the merge method using --ff-only, --no-ff, --squash, --no-commit commands
>
> --ff-only -> Used for merge changes of a branch is ahead of the current branch "The branch ahead must share the previous commits that the current branch has in the same order"
> 
> --no-ff -> Used for merging two brands that have diverged, git creates a new commit copying the changes of the branch to be merged into the current branch
> 
> --squash -> add the changes of the branch to be merged into the staging area instead of automatically committing them "The parent commits are not referenced in the new commit and the history of the feature branch is lost in the main branchâ€™s log"
>
> --no-commit -> same as --squash but the history of both branches is preserved, performing a regular merge
```
git merge <branch>

git merge --ff-only <branch> # fast forward merge

git merge <branch> --no-ff # no fast forward merge

git merge --squash # no automatically commit merge

git merge --no-commit # no automatically commit regular merge
```
- Re-committing all commits of the current branch onto a different base commit
> Use rebase to add changes from a base branch to a branched-out branch and to not create so many merge commits
> Never should be used to add changes to a base branch because you will modify the commit history
```
git rebase <branch>
```
- Delete a branch
```
git branch -d # only will delete the branch if the branch is merged

git branch -D # delete the branch regardless of whether it is being merged or not
```
- Prune the local repository of branches pushed to the remote
```
git remote prune <origin> --dry-run # return a list of branches that will be deleted if the command is used
git remote prune <origin> # delete unnecessary branches
```

### Git Remote Repository Management
- Clone a remote repository and bring it locally
```
git clone <ssh URL>
```
- Show a list of remote repositories that are linked to the local repository
```
git remote -v
```
- Config git the merge method used when pulling from a repository
```
git config pull.rebase false # use the merge method when fast-forward is not available

git config pull.rebase true # use the rebase method when fast-forward is not available

git config pull.ff only # only accept fast-forward method
```
- Pull changes from a remote repository 
```
git pull <remote> <branch>
```

- Push changes to a remote repository
```
git push <remote> <branch>
git push <remote> <branch> -f # force and avoid error message
```
